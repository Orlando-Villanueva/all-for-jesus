        On Thelema with Crusaders Fr. Chad Ripperger and Archbishop Daniel

        <p>
            The Book of the Law written by Aleister Crowley is the main source
            text of Thelema.

        <p>
            There was even a character in Yu-Gi-Oh named after Crowley. (You see
            why I use Yu-Gi-Oh memes now?)

        <p>
            Even the very name of Crowley‚Äôs work is an inversion of the biblical
            Book of the Law
        </p>

        <div>
            <p>This sure isn‚Äôt the Book of the Law described in Joshua:</p>
            <Scripture
                verses="Joshua 1:8"
                text="Keep this Book of the Law‚ÄØalways on your lips;‚ÄØmeditate‚ÄØon it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful."
            />
        </div>

        <p>
            Time for this Zoomer to zoom zoom into the Quiploth.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            It‚Äôs time to light up the darkness and allow Truth to overcome deception.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            You might want to grab a torch. It gets dark with this one.

        <p>
            I think it‚Äôs time we send Crowley‚Äôs Aiwass back to the graveyard
            where he belongs.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Let‚Äôs expose another false god for the glory of the One True God Jesus
            Christ.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            I never grow tired of showing the occultists my sting.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            But first let‚Äôs hear some words from Catholic Exorcist Fr. Chad Ripperger
            of the Augustine Institute.
        </p>

        <Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ls92Wiptv0w?feature=oembed" />

        <p>
            Faith and fear cannot coexist.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            I only maintain fear of God which makes me fearless too.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            I believe Satan has a time limit imposed by Jesus Christ when he/they
            manifest outside of a body.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            (Note: to the reader that Satan is a title and does not refer to a singular
            being).
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            I also believe this time limit shortens when a fallen spirit seeks to
            combine split forms into one.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            You‚Äôll also note how the king demon Asmodeus has three heads.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Three heads that attack the All-Powerful Most-Merciful Trinity.
        </p>

        <div class="flex flex-row lg:w-3/4">
            <Image src={img86} alt="image86" class="w-1/3" loading="lazy" />
            <Image src={img87} alt="image87" class="w-1/3" loading="lazy" />
            <Image src={img88} alt="image88" class="w-1/3" loading="lazy" />
        </div>

        <p>
            But I‚Äôll let you be the judge Fr. Ripperger.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Because you are the one who taught me the father of lies inverts the
            Almighty Uncreated Father.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            The one who taught me lucifer inverts the Light of Jesus Christ.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            The one who taught me belzeebub inverts the Life-Giving Holy Spirit.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            One in attack, three in personality. United in pride. United in defeat.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Defeat is what happens to all who try to stand against the Life-Creating
            Trinity.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            If Satan attacks once, he will often attack three times.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Three different forms. Three different manifestations. Three different
            inversions.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            He will try to enter as the false lightbringer at the base of the spine
            (remember 33 vertebrae).
        </p>

        <Scripture
            verses="Luke 22:31"
            text="3‚ÄØThen Satan‚ÄØentered Judas, called Iscariot,‚ÄØone of the Twelve."
        />

        <Scripture
            verses="John 13:27"
            text="27‚ÄØAs soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. So Jesus told him,‚ÄØ‚ÄúWhat you are about to do, do quickly."
        />

        <p>
            Say ‚ÄúIn the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit‚Äù and you‚Äôre
            safe.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            He can also be defended against with the name of Jesus Christ.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            To Archbishop Daniel of the OCA,
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            You already know I‚Äôm cheesin‚Äô whenever I see an Archbishop.

        <p>
            Fr. Daniel (not Daniel vs Bablyon but than again, I wouldn‚Äôt know üòä
            ) is an Apostolic Priest with a beautiful singing voice.
        </p>

        <p>
            I heard your words when you said that layman should spread the
            gospel too.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            I‚Äôll fly for you anytime sir.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Here‚Äôs my flight hat while I work on my picture book.

            loading="lazy"
        />

        <p>
            I dance like David before the ark when I hear Archbishop Daniel sing
            Psalms.
        </p>

        <Scripture
            verses="2 Samuel 6:14-15"
            text="14‚ÄØThen David‚ÄØdanced[a]‚ÄØbefore the‚ÄØLord‚ÄØwith all‚ÄØhis‚ÄØmight; and David‚ÄØwas‚ÄØwearing‚ÄØa linen ephod.‚ÄØ15‚ÄØSo David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the‚ÄØLord‚ÄØwith shouting and with the sound of the trumpet."
        />

        <p>
            So to follow your command sir, I now take to the air in honor of Fr.
            Ripperger and Archbishop Daniel.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            You already know we all fly as one.
