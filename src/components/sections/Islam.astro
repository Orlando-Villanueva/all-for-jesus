        <Letter header="" subheading="">
            <span
                >The Holy New Martyr Zachariah was from the Peloponnesos in
                Greece. He renounced Christ to become a Moslem, then went to
                ancient Patras and worked there as a furrier. He had a book, The
                Salvation of Sinners, which he often read. The book moved him to
                repentance, and he wept bitterly for the great evil he had done.</span
            >

            <span
                >Saint Zachariah met a certain Elder and told him of his sin.
                After praying and fasting for twenty days, he returned to the
                Elder and confessed all the sins he had committed during his
                life. When he asked the Elder's blessing to seek martyrdom, the
                holy man tried to discourage him. He warned that he might not be
                killed swiftly, but only after much torture. He also pointed out
                the danger that Zachariah would betray Christ a second time
                under the torments he would endure. The saint, aflame with zeal
                for martyrdom, said he was prepared to suffer myriad punishments
                for the sake of Christ.</span
            >

            <span
                >The Elder read the prayers of absolution and chrismated the
                saint (as is done when apostates from the Faith are received
                back into the Church), then administered the Holy Mysteries to
                him. Then he blessed Zachariah to go back to the Moslems and
                declare his faith in Christ. On his way, the saint asked
                forgiveness from each Christian he met.</span
            >

            <span
                >The holy martyr went to the judge's house and said that he had
                been deceived when he accepted their religion, but now he had
                come to his senses and returned to Christ. Saint Zachariah was
                thrown into prison, where he was beaten three times a day.</span
            >

            <span
                >Finally, the saint died by being stretched out on a rack.
                Christians asked for his body so they might bury it, but the
                Muslims refused. They said, "He is neither one of you, nor one
                of us, for he denied both religions. Therefore, he is unworthy
                of burial." His body was dragged through the streets and thrown
                into a dry well, landing on its knees in an upright position.
                Christians saw a radiant light over the well the next night, and
                hastened to venerate the saint. The Turks filled the well with
                dirt and debris to prevent such gatherings in the future.</span
            >

            <span
                >By shedding his blood, the holy New Martyr Zachariah washed
                away the sin of his denial of Christ and received an unfading
                crown of glory in the year 1782.</span

            This is the look we Christ Crusaders get when someone goes "Maybe
            it's Allah?"

        <p>
            To begin I'll honor the Desert Dwellers of the Ancient Christian
            Faith, <br class="hidden md:block" /> Desert-dwellers acquire divine
            eros by distancing themselves from all earthly temptations that would
            prevent any other love from coming between them and God. It is this divine
            eros that gives them wings to fly up to God.
            <br class="hidden md:block" /> St. Onuphrius is just one example of countless.
        </p>

            class="w-1/3 md:w-1/4"
        />

        <p>
            The venerable Desert Hermits, Elders, and Ascetics of early
            Christendom gave powerful testimony of Christ.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />

            Many were delivered the Eucharist every week by the Lord's Holy
            Angels due to their remote isolation. <br class="hidden md:block" />

            And they were not deceived by false angels of light pretending to be
            Gabriel like a certain false prophet named Muhammad.
        </p>

        <p>
            Muhammad broke the first rule of Fight Club. <br />

            Muhammad didn't test and make the spirit say Christ is Lord.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />

            And then he learned information that wasn't from Christ.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />

            Because it wasn't Gabriel bringing that message.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />

            Whoops. Tough rule to forget.

        <p>
            Muhammad had some impressive knowledge about Christ to claim he was
            just a prophet. <br class="hidden md:block" />

            Somehow learned more than St. Simeon the Stylite who prayed for 37
            years atop a pillar for example.

        <p>
            Apparently knew more than all the ascetics and martyrs and Church
            Fathers who came before him in the timeline.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />

            Testimony that was etched in blood and sacrifice from all kinds of
            peoples from all places and tribes.

            Don't you just love when you meet an "angel" in a cave who shakes
            you violently and says "Christ isn't King."

        <p>Even Muhammad was unsure if the message was from God (it wasn't)</p>
