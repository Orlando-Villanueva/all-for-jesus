        On the Occult with Crusader Isaiah Saldivar and Dr. Gene Kim

        <p>Christian soccer moms are very scared of the occultists.</p>

        <p>
            But knowledge and faith in Jesus Christ gives us Crusaders the power
            to laugh wherever we go. <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Especially when we see the occultists in their spell circles.

        />

        <p>
            I’ve never casted a spell. Why would I?
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            I already have the True King of kings Jesus Christ.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            But I’m here to chill with the occultists and maybe bring them to Christ
            too.
        </p>

        <p>
            To you occultists, I don’t care what you do but I would recommend
            just starting with Jesus Christ.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            If one of those demons/daimons get through one of your protective measures
            it’s not going to be good for you.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            It is hilarious how much a Pentagram scares the moms.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            But you can’t fault them too much I guess.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            I must confess I have missed a few episodes of The Bachelor.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            But now I can laugh like this every time I hear about those who want
            to play with demons.

        <p>
            I’m never pushy with conversion. It’s always a matter of the heart.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Always, always, always of the heart.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Stop trying to talk to every single spirit out there other than Jesus
            Christ.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            You are the most at risk because you are in communion with deceiving
            spirits.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            If all things were made by the Word, then only the Word could incarnate
            and redeem creation.

            text="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life— 2 the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us— 3 that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these things we write to you that [a]your joy may be full."

        <p>
            But I don't need to tell you much.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Because what's funny is the good occultists know Jesus is the King.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            I must tell you, opening doors is a risky path if you're not going to
            test in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            These occultists want to push lines until they're looking at me and

                chapter="22"

So shall it also be with this wicked generation.”"

        <p>Sometimes only prayer and fasting can help.</p>

            text="20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. 21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. 22 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: "

                heading="A House Divided Cannot Stand"
                text="4 And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute spoke; and the multitudes marveled. 15 But some of them said, 'He casts out demons by [a]Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.' 16 Others, testing Him, sought from Him a sign from heaven. 17 But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: 'Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls. 18 If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say I cast out demons by Beelzebub. 19 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 20 But if I cast out demons with the finger of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you. 21 When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in peace. 22 But when a stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted, and divides his [b]spoils. 23 He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.'"

Therefore they shall be your judges. 28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God is come unto you.'"
