            I’ll grab my Orthodox Study Bible. The OSB has a Septuagint Old
            Testament and New King James Version New Testament.

            The enemies of God always have to tell you because of Divine Law.

            Sometimes it’s even hidden in the name.

            Hermes Trismegistus is the writer of the Emerald Tablets.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />

            But the truth is revealed quite literally in the name.

            This loser Hermes Trismegistus calls himself three times great.

            I am what happens when fanatic zealotry meets enlightenment and love
            and understanding.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            I would die joyfully for my faith because of my understanding.

        <Scripture

            heading="A Mother and Her Sons Die for Their Faith"
            chapter="7"
            text="<p class='inline'>On another occasion a Jewish mother and her seven sons were arrested. The king was having them beaten to force them to eat pork. 2 Then one of the young men said,</p> <p> What do you hope to gain by doing this? We would rather die than abandon the traditions of our ancestors. </p>"
        />

        <p>
            (Note: Jesus fulfilled the law. You can eat pork if you're a
            Christian.)

        <Scripture
            verses="Baruch 3:9-14"
            heading="In Praise of Wisdom"
            text="<p> 9 Listen, Israel, to the commands that promise life; pay attention, and you will become wise. 10 Why is it, Israel, that you find yourself in an enemy land? Why have you grown old in a foreign country? You are ritually unclean, like the dead; 11 you are already counted among the dead. But why? 12 It is because you have left the source of Wisdom! 13 If you had walked in God's ways, you would have lived in peace forever. 14 Learn where understanding, strength, and insight are to be found. Then you will know where to find a long and full life, light to guide you, and peace. </p>"

        <Scripture
            verses="Sirach 1:25-30"
            heading="Wisdom and Reverence for God"
            text="<p class='inline'> 25 Wisdom has a treasury of wise sayings, but sinners have nothing but contempt for godliness. 26 If you want to be wise, keep the Lord's commands, and he will give you Wisdom in abundance. 27 Fearing the Lord is Wisdom and an education in itself. He is pleased by loyalty and humility. 28 Be faithful in the practice of your religion; when you worship the Lord, do it with all your heart. 29 Be careful about what you say, and don't be a hypocrite. 30 Don't be arrogant; you may suffer a fall and be disgraced. The Lord will reveal your secrets and humble you in front of everyone in the synagogue, because you did not come there with reverence for the reverence for the Lord, but with a heart full of hypocrisy.</p>"

            Let's take a look at where Hermes descended, or rather fell.

        <p>The Lord's wrath against Baal worship is mighty.</p>

            chapter="25"
            text='<p class="inline">Now Israel remained in Acacia Grove,[a] and the people began to commit harlotry with the women of Moab. 2 They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. 3 So Israel was joined to Baal of Peor, and the anger of the Lord was aroused against Israel. 4 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of the people and hang the offenders before the Lord, out in the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may turn away from Israel." 5 So Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Every one of you kill his men who were joined to Baal of Peor."</p>'

        <Scripture
            verses="Judges 6:25-26"
            text=`<p>25 Now it came to pass the same night that the Lord said to him, "Take your father's young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the wooden image that is beside it; 26 and build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down."</p>`

        <Scripture
            verses="2 Kings 10:25-28"
            text="<p>25 Now it happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in and kill them; let no one come out!” And they killed them with the edge of the sword; then the guards and the officers threw them out, and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal. 26 And they brought the sacred pillars out of the temple of Baal and burned them. 27 Then they broke down the sacred pillar of Baal, and tore down the temple of Baal and made it a refuse dump to this day. 28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal from Israel.</p>"

        <p>
            Never forget that it is Jesus Christ who forgives and wipes away
            sin. Not the fallen spirit Baal.

            Sometimes you don’t even need to get to the name of the author or
            the title before you know.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Sometimes it’s even in the cover art.

            Hermes Trismegistus has quite a few purported works that he either wrote/influenced.
            None lead to Jesus Christ.
            <br class="hidden md:block" />
            Instead, they lead to sun worship. Not worship of the Only-Begotten Son.

And He preached the word to them. 3 Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men. 4 And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”"

And they said one to another: 'The earth made without inhabitant cries the voice of their cryingst up to the gates of heaven. 3 And now to you, the holy ones of heaven, the souls of men make their suit, saying, "Bring our cause 4 before the Most High."' And they said to the Lord of the ages: 'Lord of lords, God of gods, King of kings, and God of the ages, the throne of Thy glory (standeth) unto all the generations of the 5 ages, and Thy name holy and glorious and blessed unto all the ages! Thou hast made all things, and power over all things hast Thou: and all things are naked and open in Thy sight, and Thou seest all 6 things, and nothing can hide itself from Thee. Thou seest what Azazel hath done, who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were (preserved) in heaven, which 7 men were striving to learn: And Semjaza, to whom Thou hast given authority to bear rule over his associates. And they have gone to the daughters of men upon the earth, and have slept with the 9 women, and have defiled themselves, and revealed to them all kinds of sins. And the women have 10 borne giants, and the whole earth has thereby been filled with blood and unrighteousness. And now, behold, the souls of those who have died are crying and making their suit to the gates of heaven, and their lamentations have ascended: and cannot cease because of the lawless deeds which are 11 wrought on the earth. And Thou knowest all things before they come to pass, and Thou seest these things and Thou dost suffer them, and Thou dost not say to us what we are to do to them in regard to these.'`
