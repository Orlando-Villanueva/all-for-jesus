            One third or 33 percent of the angels fell from their place in the
            Heavens. <br class="hidden md:block" />

            Coincidence? I think not. Please come to Jesus Christ.

            The reader may find it interesting to know there are 33 vertebrae in
            the spine. <br class="hidden md:block" />

            Ice becomes water at 33 degrees. <br class="hidden md:block" />

            What’s going on with the Hindu Trimurti though? And the Tridevi?

            Why is Shiva hanging out casually doing the as above, so below with
            the double triple sixes? <br class="hidden md:block" />

            You'll also note the serpents hanging out in case you were still in
            doubt.

            I like reading about your saints. Their stories are quite
            illuminating. Let’s take a peek at the Meher Baba.

            Don't you just love those spiritual transformations that leave you
            in a "nine month-long trance" with a "lack of consciousness in the
            body?" <br class="hidden md:block" />

            I think something spiritual got transferred alright. <br
                class="hidden md:block"

            You see yet why we Crusaders laugh everywhere we go?

            Thanks for telling me your god is an asshole. <br

            My Lord God Jesus Christ died so that everyone may live and live

            Five points on a pentagram. Is it really a surprise that Shiva's
            body consists of "five mantras?" <br class="hidden md:block" />

            The pentagram is the symbol of man. Shiva teaches you to worship
            yourself, become absorbed in yourself. <br
                class="hidden md:block"
            />

            The inverted pentagram is the goat btw if you didn't know. <br
                class="hidden md:block"
            />

            Same thing the Freemason Grand Architect of the Universe be trying
            to do. <br class="hidden md:block" />

            Turn people into temples of man and thus, reject the True King of
            Kings. <br class="hidden md:block" />

            When Shiva tells you to worship yourself and your own transcendence,
            <br class="hidden md:block" />

            You reject the bought and paid for offer of Jesus Christ to
            transcend to Heaven
        </p>

            You guys really like to contemplate yourselves huh? <br
                class="hidden md:block"
            />

            I'd rather be contemplating Jesus Christ. <br
                class="hidden md:block"
            />

            Anytime something wants to disidentify me with my body-mind complex
            you already know what I'm saying, <br class="hidden md:block" />

            "In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit"
